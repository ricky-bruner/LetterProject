## Letter Generator
This project seeks to be a solution for one of the issues that health insurance companies face in the realm of payment integrity: **Lettering** 

For a Health Plan to intiate the process or retrieving overpayments from providers, certain laws mandate letter communication and time windows for receipt of reply. Generating these letters from data can be a massive pain point. This project seeks to give an option to auditors to build their own letter templates in a UI, then have a back-end application generate these letters from data.

## Motivation
This Project was born out of my desire to grow my skills beyond my work environment, while attempting my own version of a solution for some challenges I face at work. I work primarily in .NET Framework, building new or enhancing/maintaining existing serverside console applications for my company. I wish to also grow my front-end skills and seek to tie everything together with the project. This is for myself, and is really just a challenge to see what I can pull off in my free time.

## Build status
The various pieces of the project are all under initial-buildout development. I am still architecting the UI, so nothing is set in stone with the file structure. The API will have numerous controllers and function off of a MongoDB that is populated with dummy data from finalized data structures. The actual letter building console application is still in planning.
